## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install Clear Thought MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@waldzellai/clear-thought):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @waldzellai/clear-thought --client claude
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
npm install @waldzellai/clear-thought
```

Or run with npx:

```bash
npx @waldzellai/clear-thought
```

## Usage

Each individual tool (e.g., `sequentialthinking`, `mentalmodel`, `debuggingapproach`, ...) is
registered on its own. In addition, four grouped toolset tools are available — `reasoning`,
`visualization`, `utility`, and `session` — which select the underlying tool via an
`operation` parameter (e.g., operation `mentalmodel` within the `reasoning` toolset).
The examples below use the toolset form.

Note on naming: individual tool names follow their historical naming — the earlier tools use
compact lowercase (`sequentialthinking`, `mentalmodel`), while later additions use snake_case
(`analogical_mapper`, `session_info`). These names are part of the public API and are kept stable.

### SWOT analysis

`swot_analysis` works in two modes. Without quadrant content it returns a facilitation
scaffold with per-quadrant guiding questions. With content provided via the optional
`strengths` / `weaknesses` / `opportunities` / `threats` arrays it returns the structured
analysis, weighted scores, ranked TOWS strategies (SO/WO/ST/WT), and match metadata.

Quadrant entries accept either a plain string or an object `{ text, impact, likelihood,
tags }` with `impact`/`likelihood` in 1–5 (default 3). Entries are returned normalized
as objects, and `towsRanked` lists the strategic pairs sorted by `impact × likelihood`
(pairScore) with a stable input-order tiebreaker.

**Breaking changes vs. the previous behavior (v2):**

- `topN` (default **5**) caps the strategic pairs per TOWS quadrant after ranking; the
  previous hard-coded 2x2 cap on the first entries per side is gone. Pass `topN: 0` for
  the unlimited cross product. `tows` and `towsRanked` are cut consistently — TOWS strings
  stay score-free, scores live only in `towsRanked` (`pair`, `score`, `tags`, `sharedTags`).
- Quadrant arrays in the response are **normalized objects** (`{ text, impact, likelihood,
  tags }`), not the raw input strings — consumers reading plain strings must switch to
  `.text`.

**Tag matching:** `matchMode: "tags"` keeps only pairs whose entries share at least one
tag (case-insensitive; `sharedTags` reports the intersection in the first side's
spelling, exactly one pair per entry combination). Untagged entries — including plain
strings — form no pairs and are reported in `meta.unpaired`. `towsRanked[].tags` mirrors
both entries' tags in input order (duplicates preserved). `meta.weightedEntries` counts
the entries supplied as objects (vs. defaulted plain strings) per quadrant.
`meta.truncatedPerQuadrant` shows where `topN` cut. The default `matchMode: "all"` keeps
the full cross product and leaves `unpaired` empty. `scores.weighted` mirrors the v1
balance/riskExposure ratios on weighted sums (impact × likelihood per entry).

### Mental Models

```typescript
const response = await mcp.callTool('reasoning', {
  operation: 'mentalmodel',
  modelName: 'first_principles',
  problem: 'How to implement a new feature?',
  steps: ['Break down the problem', 'Analyze components', 'Build solution']
});
```

### Debugging Approaches

```typescript
const response = await mcp.callTool('reasoning', {
  operation: 'debuggingapproach',
  approachName: 'binary_search',
  issue: 'Performance degradation in the system',
  steps: ['Identify performance metrics', 'Locate bottleneck', 'Implement solution'],
  findings: 'Database connections spiking during peak hours',
  resolution: 'Optimized connection pooling'
});
```

### Sequential Thinking

```typescript
const response = await mcp.callTool('reasoning', {
  operation: 'sequentialthinking',
  thought: 'Initial analysis of the problem',
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 3,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
});
```

## Docker

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t waldzellai/clear-thought .
```

```bash
docker run -it waldzellai/clear-thought
```

## Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Start the server: `npm run start:http` (or `npm start`) — listens on the `PORT` environment variable (default: `3000`)
